# ripple-detection

## environment set up

First setup your conda environment:
```
conda create --name ripple-detection
```

Activate environment:
```
conda activate ripple-detection
```

Sometimes we have problem installing library ptsa. We can build it from source instead. See instructions [here](https://github.com/pennmem/ptsa?tab=readme-ov-file#build-from-source).

Then run the following the install additional libraries:
```
conda update -f environments.yml
```
